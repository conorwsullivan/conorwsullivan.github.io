I'd like to move into a senior developer role. It's important for me to work in leading edge development environments. I pride myself on my modern React and ES6 knowledge. I am also looking to expand my skills beyond web development, and have been educating myself on machine learning, C++ and computer graphics, 3D printing, and other technologies.

I prefer a more disciplined, conservative environment. I particularly like a quiet office.
